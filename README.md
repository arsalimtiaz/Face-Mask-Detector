# Face-Mask-Detector
A CNN-based Face Mask Detector

Step 1 : Preprocess data with your dataset by running data_preprocessing.py

Step 2 : Run train.py 

Step 3 : Run livedetect.py 


Note: The dataset that I had used was an amalgamation of Prajna Bhandary's dataset(https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data) and Ashish Jangra's Face Mask ~12K Images Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset). I have also referred to Thakshila Dasun, https://github.com/aieml/face-mask-detection-keras.
